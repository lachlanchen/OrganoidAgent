# AI Agents for Multimodal Organoid Analysis and Experimentation

## Background and Motivation

Organoids – 3D miniature tissues grown in vitro – have revolutionized disease modeling, drug screening, and personalized medicine by recapitulating key features of real organs or tumors. However, analyzing organoid experiments is challenging. High-content microscopy yields massive image datasets, and organoids often come with *multi-modal* data: not only images, but also genomic/proteomic profiles and pharmacological readouts (e.g. drug dose-response curves). Integrating these diverse data streams to draw conclusions or design new experiments is labor-intensive and complex. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) can help. Recent advances in deep learning enable automated image analysis of organoids, as well as integration of imaging with molecular and drug response data to predict outcomes. At the same time, *multimodal* large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent AI frameworks have emerged, allowing AI systems to not only process text but also reason over images and data, and even propose experimental actions autonomously.

**Why a Multimodal LLM Agent for Organoids?** Combining these trends, a powerful idea is to create an **AI agent** (or a team of agents) that can analyze organoid images *and* other data in tandem, derive insights, and even plan the next experimental steps. Such an agent could dramatically accelerate research by **automating data analysis and closed-loop experimentation**. For example, instead of a human painstakingly segmenting organoid images and cross-referencing genomic mutations to decide which drug to test next, an AI agent could perform image segmentation, interpret omics data, recall biomedical knowledge, and suggest optimal drugs or experimental tweaks – all in real time. This vision aligns with cutting-edge efforts in other fields (e.g. autonomous design of photonic devices), and early prototypes in biology indicate its feasibility. To develop a *Nature Communications*-level project, we need to identify a concrete use-case where such a multimodal AI agent brings significant value, prepare the necessary AI components and datasets, and rigorously validate the system’s performance and scientific insights.

## Current Landscape: AI in Organoid Research

**High-Content Imaging and Deep Learning:** Organoid experiments often involve time-lapse microscopy or high-throughput imaging to monitor growth, morphology, and treatment responses. AI-based image analysis has made great strides in handling this visual data. For instance, the **OrganoID** platform uses deep convolutional networks to automatically recognize and **segment** individual organoids in brightfield images, even when organoids cluster together. It tracks each organoid’s size and shape over time, achieving ~95% accuracy in counting organoids and ~97% in measuring size, as validated across multiple organoid types. Notably, OrganoID’s automated analysis of a chemotherapy experiment revealed clear dose-dependent changes in organoid morphology (e.g. alterations in circularity and solidity), which would have been tedious to quantify manually. Likewise, other deep learning models (e.g. **ACU2Net**) have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in imaging-based assays, such as detecting viability in bladder cancer organoids. These tools show that AI can extract rich phenotypic features (growth rates, structural changes, cell death indicators, etc.) from organoid images **with greater throughput and consistency than manual methods**.

**Multi-Omics and Drug Response Integration:** Beyond images, organoids often come with genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic data (to characterize the organoid or patient-of-origin), and with **pharmacological data** from drug tests (dose–response curves, IC50 values, etc.). Integrating these heterogeneous data sources is critical for precision medicine. Traditional approaches struggled to combine such high-dimensional inputs, but modern AI – especially **transformer-based models** – are rising to the challenge. A striking example is **PharmaFormer**, a transformer framework that was trained on >100 patient-derived organoid lines with matched multi-omics and drug response data. PharmaFormer can ingest a given organoid’s molecular profile and predict its sensitivity to various therapies; it achieved a **precision-recall AUC of 0.81** in cross-domain therapy response prediction, showing strong performance in identifying effective drugs across different tumor types. This illustrates how multi-modal AI can find patterns linking genotype, phenotype, and drug efficacy that humans might miss. More broadly, machine learning on organoid datasets has enabled patient stratification and biomarker discovery – for example, identifying gene expression signatures that predict which tumor organoids will respond to certain targeted inhibitors. **Integrating imaging with omics further boosts reliability**: one review notes that combining organoid imaging, molecular data, and pharmacological profiles yields more robust predictions and translational relevance than any modality alone. In short, the current state-of-the-art already uses AI to fuse multiple data types and draw clinically useful insights (e.g. predicting patient-specific drug responses).

**Toward Autonomous AI-Driven Experimentation:** A very recent and exciting development is the emergence of **AI agents that actively plan and carry out experiments**. Traditionally, AI in biology has been passive – analyzing data after the fact. Now, inspired by progress in agentic AI, researchers are building systems that *close the loop* by deciding **what to do next** in an experiment based on real-time data. A prime example is the *Agentic Lab* platform (2025), which introduced a multi-agent AI system for cell and organoid experiments. Agentic Lab combines several specialized sub-agents (for knowledge retrieval, protocol design, data analysis, etc.) under the oversight of a “virtual principal investigator” agent. This AI orchestrator uses a large language model (LLM) alongside vision models to interpret experimental goals and results. In a demonstration on stem-cell derived organoids, the system autonomously generated a **differentiation protocol**, monitored the ongoing cultures via microscopic images, and detected subtle morphological heterogeneity arising from different growth conditions. Crucially, the AI agent didn’t just collect data – it **interpreted** the phenotypes in the context of prior knowledge (retrieving relevant literature on why certain morphological features might indicate suboptimal conditions) and then **proposed specific adjustments** to improve the organoid differentiation efficiency. This showcases the power of an AI agent that can reason about experimental data and actively refine protocols. Similarly, the concept of *“Artificial Intelligence Virtual Organoids (AIVOs)”* has been proposed as a way to use **digital twins** and AI for active experiment design: essentially creating in silico organoid models that integrate multimodal data and allow rapid testing of virtual perturbations, which can guide real experiments. These pioneering efforts indicate that *autonomous or semi-autonomous experimentation* in organoid research is becoming achievable, leveraging AI to optimize experiments in a closed-loop fashion.

**Summary of the Gap:** In summary, current research has separately accomplished (a) automated organoid image analysis, (b) multi-omics/drug data integration for predictions, and (c) initial demonstrations of AI agents steering experiments. The **next leap** – and a compelling idea for a high-impact project – is to *combine these elements into a unified system*. A multimodal LLM-based agent could serve as an intelligent “brain” that sees the organoid (via image models), knows the organoid’s molecular profile, recalls biomedical knowledge, and then **decides how to maximize a desired outcome**. This could significantly accelerate tasks like drug screening, phenotyping, and protocol optimization, moving towards an *AI-driven experimental platform* for organoids.

## Proposed Project Idea: Multimodal AI Agent for Organoid Experiments

**Concept Overview:** We propose to develop a **multimodal AI agent** that autonomously analyzes organoid data and guides experiments, with a focus on **drug response optimization and phenotypic analysis**. In practical terms, this system would accept multiple inputs – *microscopy images* of organoids, *genomic/proteomic data* (e.g. key mutations or expression profiles), and *metadata* such as drug compounds and concentrations tested so far – and produce two kinds of outputs: (1) **Analytic output**, e.g. quantitative phenotypes (organoid size, viability, specific morphological changes) and predictions (will a given drug likely work? what biomarkers are driving response?); and (2) **Prescriptive output**, i.e. decisions or recommendations for the *next experimental step*. The ultimate goal is a closed-loop agent that can iteratively test hypotheses on organoids – for example, finding an optimal drug or improving a culture protocol – with minimal human intervention. Below we detail three possible modes or use-cases for this agentic framework, and then discuss how to implement and validate such a system.

### Use Case 1: **Autonomous Drug Screening and Optimization**

In this scenario, the AI agent acts as an autonomous scientist conducting a drug screen on, say, patient-derived tumor organoids. The workflow might proceed as follows:

- **Initialization:** The agent is given the organoid’s background information (tumor type, key genetic alterations from sequencing, etc.) and a list of available drugs (a small library of candidate compounds or doses). It may also have access to prior knowledge (literature, databases) about these drugs and biomarkers – effectively, an LLM-based knowledge retrieval agent can supply context like “Mutation X confers resistance to Drug Y” or “Pathway A activation suggests trying inhibitor B”.
- **Iterative Experiment Cycle:** The agent selects a drug (or drug combination) to apply to the organoid culture as the first test. After treatment, high-content images are taken (possibly along with other assays, e.g. viability staining). Now the **vision sub-agent** kicks in: using a pre-trained deep model (such as a convolutional network or vision transformer), it segments the organoids and measures outcomes like growth, death, structural integrity, etc. (Tools like OrganoID could be integrated here for robust segmentation and tracking.) The agent also considers numeric readouts (e.g. ATP-based viability) and perhaps compares them to baseline. Based on these results, the **reasoning agent** (LLM) assesses how effective the drug was and hypothesizes why. For instance, it might note that “Organoids treated with Drug A shrank by 50% and show many fragmented structures, indicating cell death” and cross-reference that with the organoid’s genotype: “The organoid has an EGFR mutation that Drug A targets, which likely explains the response.”
- **Decision Making:** Given the observed response, the agent decides the next experiment. It might use a strategy like *reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization*, where the reward is something like tumor cell kill or desired phenotypic change. Alternatively, the LLM could follow heuristic rules and domain knowledge: if the first drug was effective, perhaps test a lower dose to find the minimum effective concentration; if it was ineffective, try a different mechanism drug or a combination. The knowledge agent can retrieve known synergistic pairs or potential drug resistances from literature to inform this choice. This multi-agent discussion – akin to experts consulting each other (one looking at data, one recalling knowledge, one planning) – is orchestrated to pick the next best experiment.
- **Iteration and Termination:** This loop continues, with the agent running a series of mini-experiments. Over time, it should converge on a promising treatment strategy for the organoid (for example, identifying Drug X as highly effective, or a combo that works best). The process might terminate after a fixed budget of experiments or once a success criterion is met (e.g. organoid viability below a threshold). The final output could be a ranked list of effective drugs for this organoid, along with an **explanation** of the findings (here the LLM can be used to generate a human-readable report, citing evidence from the data and literature for why a certain drug is recommended – adding interpretability to the black-box screening process).

**Value and Novelty:** This autonomous screening agent would be transformative. It essentially creates a **self-driving laboratory for personalized oncology**. Compared to brute-force screening (testing all drugs blindly) or human-guided testing, the agent could find effective therapies in fewer iterations by intelligently exploiting multimodal information. For example, if an organoid has a BRCA1 mutation, the agent might prioritize DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibitors early, potentially homing in on a treatment that causes visible DNA-damage phenotypes in organoid images (like fragmented nuclei) – something a human might only realize after looking at omics data and literature separately. By continuously learning from each experiment, the agent embodies *active learning*, focusing on the most informative experiments. This approach aligns with recent proposals of using virtual models for active experiment design, but goes a step further by involving real wet-lab tests in the loop. A system like this has not, to our knowledge, been fully realized yet – making it ripe for a high-impact publication. Early pieces of the puzzle exist (e.g. using CNNs to distinguish cytostatic vs cytotoxic drug effects in organoid images, or using transformers to predict drug efficacy from omics), but a unified agent that *plans experiments autonomously* would be a pioneering advance.

**Technical Implementation:** Building this will leverage **current AI models** as components. For image analysis, one can use or fine-tune state-of-the-art vision models on organoid images (the dataset can be generated from previous experiments or public resources). Pre-trained models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) or CellPose could handle segmentation, while specialized models (OrganoID’s architecture or similar) track growth over time. For multimodal integration, a transformer that accepts both visual features and genomic features could be employed, or simpler: the agent can treat each modality via a separate expert and combine insights via the LLM. The central decision-making could use an LLM (like GPT-4 or a fine-tuned biomedical LLM) prompted with a summary of current results and asked to propose the next step. By giving the LLM a structured prompt including experimental data (perhaps converted to textual form, e.g. “Current result: Drug A at 10 µM reduced viability by 50%, organoids show hollow structures; Genomics: KRAS G12D mutation present; Knowledge: KRAS G12D often confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors”), the model can generate a candidate next experiment (e.g. “Test a MEK inhibitor, since KRAS is downstream of EGFR” or “Increase dose to 20 µM to see if a higher kill can be achieved”). A reinforcement learning wrapper could further refine the LLM’s choices by rewarding successful outcomes over many simulated trials. Importantly, each suggestion from the agent can be checked for safety/feasibility by constraints (ensuring it doesn’t pick an impossibly high dose, etc.). Over time, the agent effectively **learns an optimal policy** for the experimental goal.

**Validation Plan:** To publish in *Nature Communications*, rigorous validation is key. This could involve: (1) **Retrospective validation** on existing datasets – for example, take published drug screening data on organoids (with images and outcomes) and simulate the agent’s decision process, showing that it would have found the efficacious drug sooner than an exhaustive search, or that its recommended top drugs align with known effective therapies. (2) **Prospective testing** in the lab – a controlled experiment where the agent is actually used to drive a small drug screen on an organoid, and then the identified treatment is confirmed via independent assays. One could also compare the agent’s strategy to human experts: do experienced scientists choose different drugs, and how do those fare relative to the agent’s picks? If the agent uncovers an unexpected effective compound (perhaps by linking patterns across modalities that humans overlooked), that would be a standout result. (3) **Generality** – demonstrate the system works on multiple organoid types or patient samples (e.g. a couple of different cancers or a healthy vs diseased organoid model) to show broad applicability. Additionally, the project should report standard metrics: success rate of finding an effective drug, number of experiments needed, and prediction accuracy for drug responses. Prior work emphasizes using patient-level holdout tests to avoid overfitting, so ensuring the agent’s predictions generalize to new organoids is crucial. By thoroughly validating that the AI agent can reliably accelerate drug discovery in organoids, the work would indeed merit a high-impact publication.

### Use Case 2: **Multimodal Phenotypic Prediction and Diagnosis**

A second application for the multimodal LLM-based approach is a **prediction and analysis tool** rather than an experimental planner. Here, the goal is to feed the agent combined data and have it output a clinically or biologically meaningful prediction. For instance, one could develop an AI model that **predicts an organoid’s drug response or disease phenotype from its image and genetic data**. This would be like a diagnostic aid or an *in silico* screening tool: given a new organoid, the AI can tell you “this one is likely to respond to EGFR inhibitors but not to immunotherapy,” or “this organoid’s morphology and mutation profile resemble an aggressive subtype of the cancer.” Such a tool could assist in patient stratification or in deciding which experiments are worth running *before* actually doing them. In effect, it’s using deep learning to emulate the experiment outcomes. Recent studies already show the promise of this: for example, a network that integrated cell-line and organoid data (multi-omics + pharmacogenomic) could predict therapy responses with high accuracy, hinting at **cross-domain generalization**. Another study used organoid imaging plus molecular data to identify features correlated with drug efficacy, improving biomarker discovery.

Our proposed twist is to leverage a **multimodal foundation model** – possibly a combination of a vision model and an LLM – to achieve these predictions in a more explainable way. Concretely, one could fine-tune a vision transformer to encode organoid images, use a transformer or graph network to encode genomic/proteomic features (or even let an LLM read a textual report of key mutations), and then fuse these in a multimodal model that outputs predictions of interest (e.g., probabilities of response to each drug). An LLM can serve as a reasoning layer that not only gives a binary prediction but also produces a rationale in natural language, citing which image features or genetic markers influenced the decision (akin to how a doctor might reason: “The organoid has a cystic morphology and a mutation in gene X, which typically means sensitivity to drug Y.”). This kind of interpretable AI could build trust and insight: researchers and clinicians could learn *why* certain features matter, not just get a black-box answer.

**Implementation and Value:** This use-case is somewhat more traditional (it’s essentially a powerful predictive model), but wrapping it in an LLM-agent framework brings two advantages: **multimodal flexibility** and **interactive analysis**. The same system could answer different questions via prompts. For example, one could ask the agent “compare the phenotypic response of organoid A and B given their data” or “which known oncogenic pathway is most active in this organoid and what drug targets it?” The LLM can use its trained knowledge plus the data to answer these in sentence form, making the tool a smart assistant for data interpretation. The value of such a system is in streamlining analysis: instead of separate pipelines for image analysis, omics analysis, and then correlation, a unified model handles it all. **Phenotypic prediction** could drastically speed up hypothesis generation – e.g., before testing 100 drugs on an organoid, you use the model to narrow it down to 5 likely effective ones (reducing cost and time). In terms of novelty, a few multimodal models in precision medicine exist, but the integration of an LLM that can incorporate unstructured knowledge (like literature) with the data is new. Imagine the agent noticing a rare phenotype in the image and recalling a journal article that linked that phenotype to a specific pathway – it could flag that insight on the fly, something conventional models don’t do.

**Validation:** This predictive mode would be validated by standard metrics: e.g. how well does it predict drug response (AUC, accuracy) on a held-out set of organoids? You would train on a portion of a multi-modal organoid dataset and test on unseen organoids. An interesting validation extension is **prospective**: use the model to predict a novel result (e.g. “Organoid X will respond to Drug Y”) and then actually perform that experiment to see if it’s correct. Additionally, measuring the benefit of multimodality is important: one could show that using images+genomics together outperforms using either alone, quantitatively confirming the integrative approach is superior (this aligns with observations that multi-modal integration improves reliability). If the LLM provides explanations, one can qualitatively assess if those make sense biologically (perhaps even have experts blindly rate whether the agent’s explanations align with known science). A high-profile publication would likely require demonstrating not just performance, but also new biological insights – e.g., the model might highlight a previously underappreciated morphologic feature that correlates with drug resistance, suggesting a new hypothesis to explore.

### Use Case 3: **Semi-Autonomous Assistant for Experimental Design**

This scenario is a middle ground: instead of full autonomy, the AI agent acts as a **co-pilot for scientists**. It could be implemented as a software assistant that researchers interact with during organoid experiments. For instance:

- A researcher could ask the agent in real-time: “I added Drug X to the organoids, and they are turning dark in the center – what does that indicate?” The vision model would analyze the latest images, and the LLM might respond: “The organoids show signs of central necrosis (dark cores), which often indicates a strong cytotoxic effect. This suggests Drug X is causing cell death at the core. You might want to measure apoptosis markers to confirm.” The agent could cite relevant literature or past data about such morphology.
- The assistant could also observe the process passively (via a camera feed of organoids, or via data logs). If it detects an anomaly or opportunity, it alerts the human. For example, if two conditions in a screen are trending towards very different outcomes early on, the agent might flag: “Condition A is already showing organoid disintegration while B is not – perhaps focus resources on exploring A further.” In the Agentic Lab demonstration, the system used an augmented reality interface to guide a human, catching protocol deviations and providing tips. Our proposed assistant could similarly guide – e.g. reminding the experimenter to change media if the organoids’ growth metrics plateau, or suggesting “Given the slow growth, consider increasing growth factor concentration.”
- Another use: **experimental planning**. A scientist could describe a goal (“I want to differentiate iPSCs into liver organoids with high efficiency”) and the agent can draft a protocol by drawing from databases of known recipes and its own reasoning. It might generate a step-by-step plan (which the human can review and modify) and then remain available to adjust it as results come in. This is akin to having an encyclopedic lab partner who also crunches data on the fly.

The semi-automated approach is practical because it keeps a human in the loop for final decisions (important for safety and for complex judgment calls), but it still significantly offloads analysis and information gathering to AI. It could be the *precursor* to full autonomy: you’d first demonstrate the agent’s utility as an advisor, then gradually let it take more control as confidence increases.

**Value:** The assistant accelerates research by reducing human error (flagging issues in real time), maintaining a knowledge base at your fingertips (no need to manually search literature mid-experiment), and suggesting innovative ideas that a human might not think of. It also lowers the barrier to entry for complex organoid techniques – a less experienced researcher could be guided by the AI to avoid common pitfalls. This is of high value especially given organoid protocols can be intricate and failure-prone. In terms of publishable results, one could demonstrate that using the AI assistant leads to better outcomes: e.g., labs using the assistant achieve higher success rates in organoid formation or identify hits in a drug screen that manual analysis missed.

**Validation:** To validate this mode, user studies can be done. For example, have some scientists use the AI assistant during an experiment and others work normally, and compare outcomes (accuracy of analyses, time taken, success of experiments). Even anecdotal but compelling use-case demonstrations can be impactful – for instance, “the AI assistant caught a subtle phenotypic change that predicted experiment failure, allowing us to intervene and save the culture, whereas without it we would have lost that batch.” If those anecdotes are backed by systematic evidence of improvement, it strengthens the case. As a tech demo, one could show the agent generating a protocol that, when executed, yields organoids of comparable quality to a standard protocol – proving that the AI’s plan was sound. Documentation of the agent’s advice along with outcomes can be supplementary material.

## Key Components and Preparation for the Project

To realize any of the above scenarios (or a combination of them), you will need to **integrate several cutting-edge components**:

- **Vision Model for Image Analysis:** A robust image analysis pipeline is fundamental. You might adopt an existing tool like *OrganoID* for organoid segmentation and tracking, or use general models (e.g. U-Net, Mask R-CNN, or Vision Transformers) trained on organoid images. Ensure it can output meaningful quantitative features: number of organoids, size distribution, texture features, live/dead cell indicators (if using stains), etc. For real-time analysis, this model should be efficient. Also consider 3D image data if organoids are imaged with z-stacks; 3D CNNs might be needed.
- **Omics Data Processing:** If genomic or proteomic data is included, you’ll need a way to embed that information for the AI. Simpler models could just take as input known key mutations or expression of a few markers (e.g. “TP53 mutant, HER2 overexpressed”), which an LLM can incorporate as text. More complex would be using a dedicated model (like a graph neural network on gene networks or a transformer on gene expression profiles) to produce a numerical embedding that the agent can reason with. An emerging idea is to prompt LLMs with relevant genomic facts in natural language (e.g. feed it: “Genomic profile: mutation1 in geneX (pathway...), mutation2 in geneY, etc.”) – since LLMs have ingested biological knowledge, this might let the model connect genotype to known drug sensitivities on its own.
- **Knowledge Integration:** One sub-agent should be able to query biomedical knowledge bases or literature. This could be implemented with a retrieval-augmented LLM: for example, use a search tool or a local database of papers to fetch information about a given gene or drug, and have the LLM summarize or extract actionable points. This is crucial for an agent to ground its decisions in science (e.g. knowing that “drug X is a VEGFR inhibitor and the organoid shows hypoxia – maybe relevant”). Ensuring the agent cites or checks facts will increase the credibility of its suggestions.
- **LLM Orchestrator and Self-Reflection:** At the heart is the LLM-based agent that orchestrates everything. Frameworks like the one used in MetaChat (for optics design) give LLMs a kind of self-reflective loop – they can generate a plan, then double-check it (“self-refine”), and only then execute. Incorporating such self-reflection can prevent obvious mistakes and improve stability. The orchestrator should manage the sequence: take inputs from image analysis and omics, consult the knowledge agent, then decide on output (be it an experimental action or a prediction). It might maintain a **memory** of past experiments (so it doesn’t repeat ineffective ones and can detect patterns over rounds).
- **User Interface / Integration with Lab:** For a practical system, consider how it will interface with the physical world. In a full autonomous setup, this means linking to lab automation (robotic liquid handlers, plate readers, etc.). That is complex, but a simpler initial step is just a well-designed UI that displays the agent’s analysis and suggestions to a human experimenter. For instance, a dashboard showing organoid metrics updated in real-time and a text feed of the agent’s commentary (“Day 3: organoids have doubled in size, trending well. Suggest next: add differentiation factor”). This makes the agent’s presence tangible and useful.

**Preparing Data and Experiments:** To publish in *Nature Communications*, you should ideally **show results on real experimental data**. Thus, plan to either generate or obtain a dataset that includes: organoid images over time, corresponding interventions (drug treatments or different conditions), and possibly multi-omics characterization of those organoids. If focusing on cancer organoids for drug screening, you might use patient-derived organoids from a partner lab or public biobank, with known mutations and test a panel of drugs while imaging the response. Ensure the dataset is sufficiently large or diverse to train your models (though transfer learning can help if data is limited). It’s also wise to include an **external validation set** – e.g., train the agent or model on organoids from lab A, test on organoids from lab B – to prove generalization.

Additionally, define clear **evaluation metrics** for your specific aim. For the autonomous agent, this might be metrics like “number of experiments to achieve a 80% killing of organoids” or success rate in identifying an effective drug. For predictive tasks, use AUC, accuracy, etc., and for assistant tasks, maybe user survey scores or error rates in protocol execution. Having quantitative benchmarks will make your case stronger.

## Anticipated Results and Impact

By the end of the project, you should aim to demonstrate something that hasn’t been shown before. For example, you might present a result like: *“Our AI agent identified optimal treatments for patient-derived tumor organoids in 3 iterative cycles, whereas traditional brute-force screening of 10 drugs would have taken much longer. In one case, the agent recommended a drug that was not initially obvious, which proved highly effective (80% cell death) in the organoid and was later confirmed as effective in the patient’s tumor xenograft.”* Such a finding would be headline-worthy. On the analytical side, you might report that *“the multimodal model predicted drug responders vs non-responders with X% accuracy, outperforming models using only genomics or only imaging by a significant margin, and uncovered a morphologic feature (e.g. organoid budding shape) that correlates with a specific genetic alteration, offering a new potential biomarker.”* If you implement the assistant mode, an impactful anecdote could be: *“Using the AI co-pilot, we successfully grew liver organoids with 50% higher efficiency. The agent’s recommendations (such as adjusting Wnt pathway activation timing) were later validated by our follow-up studies, indicating that the AI discovered an improved protocol.”*

In terms of figures/tables for a publication: you would include examples of organoid images with the AI’s segmentation/analysis overlaid, charts of experimental iterations (showing how the agent converges on a solution), performance curves for prediction, and maybe a schematic of the multi-agent architecture. If possible, a comparative table showing how your approach differs from prior organoid-AI works (e.g., highlighting the addition of real-time decision-making, or the integration of more modalities than before) will emphasize novelty.

Finally, **broader impact**: Emphasize in your discussion that such an AI agent framework can be generalized beyond your specific demonstration. It could be adapted to other organoid types (brain, liver, disease-specific organoids) or even to other biomedical domains where experiments are iterative and data-rich (e.g. cell line engineering, bioprocess optimization). By showcasing a successful case in organoids, you set the stage for a new paradigm of AI-driven research. As noted by experts, the integration of agentic AI into labs *“transforms experimentation from a static workflow into an adaptive, feedback-driven process”*. This vision – of AI and scientists working together in a loop – is likely to inspire follow-up work and garner substantial attention, aligning well with the innovative spirit of a journal like *Nature Communications*.

**Conclusion:** In summary, a concrete and valuable project is to create a **multimodal LLM-powered agent for organoid analysis and experiment planning**, with an initial focus on drug response optimization. This leverages the latest AI models and addresses a pressing need in biomedicine: making sense of complex organoid data and speeding up discovery. By reviewing current advances and combining them in a novel way, you can position your work at the forefront of AI in experimental biology. With careful implementation and thorough validation, such a study could indeed be worthy of a high-impact publication, demonstrating how intelligent agents can unlock new capabilities in organoid research and beyond.
